The emulator is not complete: I need to implement sound, the gameplay isn't very fluid, and it doesn't work correctly with some ROMs, like Space Invaders and Glitch Ghost. The priority now is to find why it breaks with these games and fix it.

There are some other functionalities I want to add to it:
* A debug mode.
* The ability to pause the emulator.
* An assembler.
